# metrics

Toolkit to automatically collect OCF metrics (such as the number of people signed up to our newsletter) and store them over time.
All data can be found in `data/`. It gets updated daily via various GitHub Actions.

Note that this repository _isn't_ about metrics for machine learning experiments or forecasting!  ML and forecasting metrics can be found in [`nowcasting_utils`](https://github.com/openclimatefix/nowcasting_utils)!
